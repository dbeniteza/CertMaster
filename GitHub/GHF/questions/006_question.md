# You are reviewing proposed changes in a pull request in the GitHub UI. What options are available to you in order to evaluate the pull request and make a decision to approve it or not? (select five)

> You can review changes in a pull request one file at a time. While reviewing the files in a pull request, you can leave individual comments on specific changes. After you finish reviewing each file, you can mark the file as viewed. This collapses the file, helping you identify the files you still need to review. A progress bar in the pull request header shows the number of files you've viewed. After reviewing as many files as you want, you can approve the pull request or request additional changes by submitting your review with a summary comment.
