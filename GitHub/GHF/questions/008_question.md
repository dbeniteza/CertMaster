# When creating a codespace development environment in GitHub, what is the default operating system, and what platforms are not supported for the remote development container?

> By default, the codespace development environment is created from an Ubuntu Linux image that includes a selection of popular languages and tools, but you can use an image based on a Linux distribution of your choice and configure it for your particular requirements. Regardless of your local operating system, your codespace Will run in a Linux environment. Windows and macOS are not supported operating systems for the remote development container.
