# What are helpful topics to include to classify a GitHub repository? (select three)

> GitHub topics all you to explore repositories in a particular subject area, find projects to contribute to, and discover new solutions to a specific problem. Helpful topics to classify a repository include the repository's intended purpose, subject area, community, or language. Additionally, GitHub analyzes public repository content and generates suggested topics that repository admins can accept or reject. Private repository content is not analyzed and does not receive topic suggestions.
