# Ned wants to give users easy access to important or frequently used repositories within his organization. What organizational setting can he use to achieve this?

> You can give users easy access to important or frequently used repositories, by choosing up to six repositories for public users and Six repositories for members of the organization. Once you pin repositories to your organization profile, the "Pinned" section is shown above the "Repositories" section of the profile page.
