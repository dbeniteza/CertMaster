# You are looking through issues on a project so you can contribute but are unsure if anyone is working on an issue. What GitHub feature can your team use to better inform other team members about who is working on an issue?

> You can link a pull request or branch to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when the pull request or branch is merged. You can link an issue to a pull request manually or using a supported keyword in the pull request description. When you link a pull request to the issue the pull request addresses, collaborators can see that someone is working on the issue. When you merge a linked pull request into the default branch of a repository, its linked issue is automatically closed.
