# What is the primary purpose of a Version Control System (VCS)?

> A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that **helps manage changes to source code, documents, and other files in a collaborative environment**. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously by tracking changes made to the files over time. VCS provides features such as version history, branching, and merging, which help maintain a structured development process, reduce conflicts, and enable efficient collaboration. The main goal is to ensure that changes can be tracked, reverted if necessary, and integrated seamlessly into the project, promoting a systematic and organized approach to software development.
