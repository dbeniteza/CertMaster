# When working with GitHub repositories, what is the purpose of cloning a repository to your local machine?

> Cloning allows you to copy the entire repository from GitHub.com to your local machine or codespace, providing a full version history and enabling contributions to the project. This process facilitates collaboration by allowing contributors to work locally and make changes before pushing them to the remote repository.
