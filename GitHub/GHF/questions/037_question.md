# After passing the GitHub Foundations exam, Kyle is curious about upcoming features on GitHub and wants to explore new functionalities before they are officially released. What feature should he use to access and test these upcoming capabilities?

> Feature Previews allow users like Kyle to **access and test upcoming GitHub functionalities** before they are officially released. Enabling feature previews provides a preview of the latest enhancements and features that GitHub is actively developing. These features are released in **Alpha**, **Beta**, and then finally go **GA**.
