# You have committed some code in your private repository but want to share it with a colleague for review and collaboration. Considering the situation, how can you easily share the code without giving your colleague direct access to your repository?

> Creating a GitHub Gist for the code and sharing the Gist URL with your colleague is the most suitable option. Gists allow you to share code snippets or files without granting access to the entire repository, making it ideal for review and collaboration.
