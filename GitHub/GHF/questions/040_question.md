# GitHub offers several ways to customize a codespace. What can you customize? (select four)

> When you're working in a codespace, you can open a new terminal window with a shell of your choice, change your default shell for new terminal windows, or install a new shell. You can also use dotfiles to configure your shell.
> 
> Codespaces that use the default dev ontainer image come with the `bash`, `zsh`, and `fish` shells installed. If you open a new codespace in the VS Code web client, or connect to a codespace over SSH, the terminal opens with a `bash` session running by default. In the VS Code desktop application, the default shell depends on your local settings and operating system.
> 
> By default the machine type with the Iowest valid resources is used when you create a codespace. You can choose an alternative machine type either when you create a codespace or at any time after you've created a codespace.

> You can manually select the region that your codespaces Will be created in, allowing you to meet stringent security and compliance requirements. By default, your region is set automatically, based on your location.
