# As an open-source contributor on many projects, Kristina has trouble keeping up with notifications and mentions across projects. Today, she needs to review and take action on any comments where she was tagged or mentioned. How can Kristina quickly sort through notifications in GitHub so only comments where she was mentioned are shown?

> To use the notifications inbox on GitHub and GitHub Mobile, you must enable web and mobile notifications in your notification settings. To access your notifications inbox, in the upper- right corner of any page, click the bell icon.
> 
> Your inbox shows all of the notifications that you haven't unsubscribed to or marked as **Done**. You can customize your inbox to best suit your workflow using filters, viewing all or just unread notifications, and grouping your notifications to get a quick overview.
> 
> By default, your inbox will show read and unread notifications. To see only unread notification, click **Unread** or use the `is:unread` query.
