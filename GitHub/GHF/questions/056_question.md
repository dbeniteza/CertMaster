# Why might a developer use a branch for development in Git or GitHub?

> Developers use branches to create an isolated environment for specific tasks, such as developing new features or fixing bugs. By doing so, they can work independently without affecting the main codebase. This isolation allows for focused development, testing, and collaboration, and the changes can be later merged back into the main branch or another target branch.
