# As a GitHub project manager, you are reaching the maximum limit of items in a project, and you need a way to manage the project's content so there are no interrumptions. What GitHub feature can you archive items as they are closed as `completed` or `not planned`?

> You can configure your project's built-in workflows to automatically archive items that match a filter. Archiving items will help you stay below the limit of 1,200 items in each project. The auto-archive workflow supports a subset of filters. You can use the following filters when configuring your workflow.
