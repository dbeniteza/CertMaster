# Organization owners can require two-factor authentication in their organization for all of the following except:

> Organization owners can require **organization members**, **outside collaborators**, and **billing managers** to enable two-factor authentication for their personal accounts, making it harder for malicious actors to access an organization's repositories and settings. **Repository viewers** who have read-only access to repositories, **are not subject to the organization-wide two-factor authentication requirement**.
