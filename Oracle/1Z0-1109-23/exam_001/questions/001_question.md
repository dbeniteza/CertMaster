# A software development team has a pipeline set up for their application code, which automatically builds and tests the code on each commit. Once the build and test stages are successful, the team deploys the code to a staging environment. However, the deployment to the production environment is done manually after approval from the team lead. Which DevOps practice does this scenario best represent?

> Continuous Delivery is a DevOps practice in which the development team ensures that the application code is always ready for deployment to production by automating the build, test, and deployment processes. In the scenario, the development team has already automated the build and test stages and deploys the code to a staging environment automatically. However, the deployment to the production environment is done manually after approval from the team lead, which is a common practice in Continuous Delivery.
