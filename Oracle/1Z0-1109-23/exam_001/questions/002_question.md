# What is the best definition of the DevOps life cycle?

> DevOps is a set of practices that emphasizes collaboration and communication between development and operations teams to deliver software more efficiently and reliably. The DevOps life cycle involves a rapid-release approach to software development, with multiple phases that include planning, development, testing, deployment, and monitoring.
