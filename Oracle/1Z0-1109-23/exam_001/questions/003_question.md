# Which of these is NOT a benefit of utilizing DevOps as a service on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)?

> DevOps aims to enhance collaboration, streamline processes, and accelerate development cycles, ultimately leading to faster delivery of applications to the market. The statement "Delayed development progress and prolonged time-to-market for applications" contradicts this fundamental DevOps principle. In a successful DevOps implementation, development progress is expected to be more efficient, leading to shorter time-to-market rather than delays. Thus, this outcome runs counter to the core objectives of DevOps practices.
