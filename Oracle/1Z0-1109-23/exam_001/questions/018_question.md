> The properties of existing worker nodes in a node pool cannot be changed. Instead, you can create a new node pool with the desired properties and move the workloads from the old node pool to the new one. This allows you to scale the node pool up and down, add or remove nodes, and configure autoscaling for node pools and pods.
