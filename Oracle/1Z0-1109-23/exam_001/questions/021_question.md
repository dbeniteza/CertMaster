# Which statement is true about virtual nodes in a serverless Kubernetes model?

> Virtual nodes use OCI Container Instances to run containers, which provides strong isolation through virtualization. This is a key feature of virtual nodes and distinguishes them from traditional container hosts.

1. [ ] Virtual nodes use traditional nodes to run containers, which provides strong isolation through virtualization.
1. [ ] Virtual nodes require manual configuration and management, which can add additional operational overhead.
1. [x] Virtual nodes eliminate operational overhead of traditional container hosts by shifting to a serverless Kubernetes model that uses a fully managed virtual kubelet and OCI container instances.
1. [ ] Specialized application use cases require virtual nodes instead of traditional nodes.
