# A DevOps team is using the Canary Deployment strategy to deploy a new version of their application to a production environment. They want to ensure that any potential issues with the new version are detected before it's fully deployed to production. Which stage of the Canary Deployment strategy in the OCI DevOps service allows the team to shift a percentage of the production traffic to the canary environment?

> In Shift traffic stage, a part of the production traffic is shifted to the canary environment. In Invoke function stage, a custom function can be added to the pipeline to validate the deployment in the canary environment. The invoked function tests the new version before moving to the production environment. In Manual approval stage, a manual approval step is added to approve the deployment in the canary environment before deploying the application in the production environment. There is no stage such as Load distribution stage.

1. [x] Shift traffic stage
1. [ ] Load distribution stage
1. [ ] Invoke function stage
1. [ ] Manual approval stage
