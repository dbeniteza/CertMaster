# You are a DevOps engineer responsible for deploying a critical application that your company's finance department uses. The Blue-Green deployment strategy is being used to ensure that any down time is minimized. Which stage of the Blue-Green deployment strategy in the OCI DevOps service involves testing the new version of the application in the standby environment before switching the production traffic?

> A custom function can be added to the Invoke function stage in the Blue-Green deployment strategy to validate the application in the standby environment before shifting the production traffic. This function can be used to perform additional testing and validation of the new version, such as running automated tests or checking the application's functionality. Once the validation is complete, the traffic shift can be performed to make the new version the production environment.
