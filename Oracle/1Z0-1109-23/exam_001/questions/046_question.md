# Which feature of the OCI Resource Manager service will you use to differentiate between the real-world state of your infrastructure and the stack's last executed configuration?

> OCI Resource Manager service provides drift detection feature that helps to detect the differences between the current state of the resources and the desired state of the stack. It helps to identify the configuration drifts that may occur due to the changes made outside of the Resource Manager. This feature allows users to take corrective actions by applying the drift detected changes to the stack or by updating the resource configuration.
