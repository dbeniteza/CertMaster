# You are responsible for managing access and permissions in Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) for Kubernetes object operations.

When considering whether to use OCI Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies or Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) roles, which of the following statements is correct?

> Both IAM policies and RBAC roles can be used to manage access in Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE). IAM policies can be used to manage access to the OKE service and resources, such as clusters, nodes, and load balancers, while RBAC roles can be used to manage access to Kubernetes objects within a cluster, such as pods, services, and deployments. By using both IAM policies and RBAC roles, you can provide granular access control for both the OKE service and Kubernetes objects within a cluster.

1. [ ] Only RBAC roles can be used to manage access.
1. [x] Both IAM policies and RBAC roles can be used to manage access.
1. [ ] You must choose either IAM policies or RBAC roles to manage access.
