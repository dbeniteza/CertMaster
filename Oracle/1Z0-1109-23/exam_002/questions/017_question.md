# You are a software developer working on a project that requires containerization of your application using Docker. Your company uses Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry to store and manage Docker images. What is the prerequisite step you need to perform before pushing and pulling Docker images to and from OCI Registry using Docker CLI?

> Before you can push and pull Docker images to and from OCI Registry using Docker CLI, you need to authenticate with the registry. You can do this by providing an auth token which can be obtained from the OCI console. This token is used for authorization and access control. Once you have obtained the token, you can use it to authenticate Docker CLI to access the OCI Registry.

1. [ ] Docker registry secret
1. [ ] SSH key pair
