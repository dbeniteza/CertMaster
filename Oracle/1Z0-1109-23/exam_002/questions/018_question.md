# If you're using OCI DevOps, which two statements about the deployment pipeline are FALSE?

> You can bring a build stage into your deployment pipeline. This is false because in OCI DevOps, build stages are separate from deployment stages and are used to generate artifacts that are used in the deployment pipeline. The Control-Wait stage in the deployment pipeline adds a specified delay duration, which causes the deployment to pause. However, the pipeline will resume automatically once the duration has elapsed, without requiring any manual intervention.

- [x] Control-Wait stage pauses the deployment for a specified duration for manual decision from the approver.
- [ ] You can add stages in a sequence or in parallel to your deployment pipeline.
- [ ] You can add multiple stages to your deployment pipeline.
- [x] You can bring a build stage into your deployment pipeline.
- [ ] You can remove any stage from your deployment pipeline.
