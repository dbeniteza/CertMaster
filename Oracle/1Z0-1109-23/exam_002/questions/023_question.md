# A team has put in place an automated pipeline for software development that builds and tests code with each commit. Upon completion of the build and test phases, the code is subsequently deployed to a staging environment. However, the team lead must give permission before the deployment can be made to the production environment. Which particular DevOps technique fits this situation?

> Continuous Delivery is a practice in which code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to a staging environment after each commit to version control. This automated pipeline ensures that the software is continuously ready for deployment to production. However, in Continuous Delivery, the final decision to deploy the code to the production environment is made manually by a team member, typically the team lead or a designated authority. This manual approval step is often referred to as the "deployment gate" and ensures that there is a human checkpoint before changes are promoted to the production environment.
