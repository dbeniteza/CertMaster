# Which Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service enables you to scan images in a repository for security vulnerabilities published in the publicly available Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database?

> You can set up Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry (also known as Container Registry) to scan images in a repository for security vulnerabilities published in the publicly available Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. You enable image scanning by adding an image scanner to a repository. From then on, any images pushed to the repository are scanned for vulnerabilities by the image scanner.
