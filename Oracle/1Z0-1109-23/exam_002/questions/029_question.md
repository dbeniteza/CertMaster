# Despite offering valuable insights into system behavior, observability has certain limitations. Which task is beyond the scope of observability alone?

> Observability provides valuable insights into system behavior but does not directly handle automating the deployment process. Automating software deployments typically involves additional tools and practices such as CI/CD pipelines and automation scripts, which go beyond the scope of observability. Automation requires coordinating various stages of the deployment process, including building, testing, and deploying software to different environments, and often involves a combination of observability and other specialized tools.
