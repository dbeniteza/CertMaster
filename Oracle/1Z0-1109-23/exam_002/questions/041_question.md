# As an operations team member, you want to collect information about the severity of a software vulnerability using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). Which service provides this information?

> The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is a repository of standards-based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). The NVD provides a variety of security-related information, including the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores for identified vulnerabilities. The CVSS is a standard method for assessing and scoring the severity of security vulnerabilities, providing a quantitative way to compare and prioritize security risks. Therefore, the NVD is the most appropriate service to provide information on the severity of a software vulnerability using the CVSS.
